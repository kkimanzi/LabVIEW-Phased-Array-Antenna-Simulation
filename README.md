# LabVIEW-Phased-Array-Antenna-Simulation
**Overview**
In this discussion, a LabVIEW simulation is provided to visualize the radiation pattern of the phased array antenna. The equations of the two-antenna array are first derived, followed by that for a generalized phased array antenna. The LabVIEW project to aid in visualization of this is then presented.

An antenna array is a group of similar antennas spaced and phased out regularly. The antenna array aims to improve the directivity and gain of the radiated beam. The dipole antenna was simple and radiated omnidirectionally. This resulted in reduced gain and directivity. With the antenna array, the individual contributions of each dipole antenna in the array add up such as to produce the desired radiation pattern.
